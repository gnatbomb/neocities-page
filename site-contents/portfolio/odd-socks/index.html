<h1 id="-audio-handler-https-github-com-gnatbomb-odd-socks-blob-main-duality-autoloads-musiccontroller-gd-"><a href="https://github.com/gnatbomb/Odd-Socks/blob/main/Duality/Autoloads/MusicController.gd">Audio Handler</a></h1>
<p>I created an audio handler that allows for simple and consistent audio playback, with the ability to modify sounds to give each sock a unique &quot;voice&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the issues I ran into while putting sounds into this game was with how Godot (the game engine we used) handles playing sound files. Naively, I assumed that the AudioStreamPlayer could be passed a sound file whenever you wanted to play a sound. I soon discovered that while you can do that, it can only handle a single sound at a time, and if it was already playing a sound, the file would cut off to play the new one.</p>
<p>Making an AudioStreamPlayer for each possible sound effect would be cumbersome for adding new sounds, and still ran the risk that a sound would not be done playing when it was called again.</p>
<p>My solution to this problem was to create a function that we could easily call to play sound effects, so that all audio playback could be handled in one place.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gnatbomb/Odd-Socks/blob/main/Duality/Autoloads/MusicController.gd">Function code here!</a></p>
<p>The function play_SE(player, noise) plays the sound effect associated with the &quot;noise&quot; argument, and shifts the pitch of the sound up or down slightly depending on the &quot;player&quot; argument. Shifting the sound effects like this creates a &quot;voice-like&quot; effect, giving each sock a unique voice and personality, while also creating clarity on the origin of each sound.</p>
<p>The audio handler walks through a list of AudioStreamPlayers to find one that is not playing a file, and then shifts the chosen AudioStreamPlayer&#39;s pitch up or down, depending on the player associated with the sound, and finally it plays the audio.</p>
<p>For the case of the walking sound, to prevent the handler from having multiples of that sound playing at once, I used a dedicated AudioStreamPlayer for each sock. When a walking sound effect is requested, the handler checks if the player&#39;s walking AudioStreamPlayer is playing a file, and does nothing if it is, or plays the file if it isn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Overall, this made it very simple to make large changes to all of the audio in the game, and made handling the game audio simple and and easy.</p>
